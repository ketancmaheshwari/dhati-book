\section{Dhatki (Thari) Language}
Many languages are spoken in India. Every region has a different language or should we say regions are made languagewise. Thing every person who uses to express his feelings is dialect. Inter-human relationships are different at different places and depends upon geography, business and community. And so is the dialect. Still dialect maintains the characteristics of its place of origin. How-ever one tries to hide but in the time of trouble one would send a call of distress in his own dialect.

It is said that every 12 miles the language changes. So the language at one end of a region might be considerably different than that of the other end, and sometimes it becomes even difficult to understand. Based on such languages, it is decided what part the speaker comes from. For example: In Gujarat, people from Kutchtch, Saurashtra, Mahesana, Surat etc. have distinct and identifiable accent and style of speaking.

Formal language means a language for general purposes, administration, education and social interaction. In that way, dialect is specific to a particular region but a language spans the whole country. Indian constitution has officiated several languages. After this introduction, let us see about the Thari/Dhatki language.

Thar Desert (The Great Indian Desert) is considered to be spread across South edge of Punjab to the west of Rajasthan to the Khairpur district till the south of TharParkar District upto the Great Rann of Kutchtch. Maheshwaris migrated from that region to the TharParkar region of Sindh and the dialect they spoke was so called Thari from the Thar Desert. People settled in the ``Dhat'' region called their dialect ``Dhatki''. As per the Encyclopedia Brittanica, vol. XVI, page 781:
\begin{quote}
 DHATKI, a dialect of Rajasthani is spoken in south-eastern TharParkar District.
\end{quote}
As per the 1931 census of India (Bombay Presidency):
\begin{quote}
Thari/Dhatki is regarded linguistically as a dialect of Sindhi but enumerated as a separate language in census. For this procedure, there is a clear authority as THARI is recognised in Sindh as a distinct from Sindhi and has an area of its own.
\end{quote}
George Gearson authored linguistic survey of India indicates that:
\begin{quote}
The language of TharParkar and Jaiselmer is mostly standard Marwadi. It has a mixture of Sindhi and Gujarati to a little extent only.
\end{quote}
According to Shri Bherumal Maherchand Advani Authored ``\textit{Sindhi Boli ji Tarikh}'', ``A new kind of language has been formed by a combination of Sindhi, Marwadi, and Gujarati. It is called Dhatki means language considered to be spoken in Dhat. This mixed dialect is considered an alternate to Rajasthani but is very close to Gujarati.''

According to what is indicated in the Gazetteer of Bombay Presidency, CUTCH, Feb, 1880, Chapter III, Population: Traers, page 50 \& 51, ``Maheshwaris arrived in Kutchtch approximately 500 years ago via Nagor--Thar and settled in the Abdasa Talluka. They spoke Thar-Gujarati language, used to put on turban like the Baniyas of Thar ... etc''. (Note: In the above writing, the mention of Thar is used in the sense of \textit{Greater-Thar} means the Great Indian Desert area and not the `Thar' TharParkar area where Maheshwaris settled late. In around A.D. 1300, Maheshwaris spoke ``Thar-Gujarati'' language which is likely to be a mixture of Thar's Marwari and Kutchtch's Gujarati.)

The dialect Maheshwaris brought from Marwar and the one spoken in dhat went under the influence of the dialects spoken in the surrounding region resulting in many gradual changes. These surrounding languages includes Gujarati in the east, Kutchtchi in the South Sindhi in the west and Rajasthani (Marwadi) in the North. Like this, variations of basic dialect resulted in Dhatki language.

For some years Thar was under the administration of Kutchtch state's ``political agent'', so the official language was Gujarati. This was also an influential factor on the Thari dialect.

In the school's of Thar, initially Gujarati, then Gujarati and Sindhi and later on in approximately A.D. 1940, only Sindhi was taught. Apart from that the Baniyas of Thar used to write ``Modi'' Gujarati (basic Gujarati characters without additional accents) in their books. This Gujarati was called ``Vaniki'' gujarati.

When Maheshwaris migrated from Marwar they came from Jaiselmer to Umarkot via Ratokot. After that they started living in Thar according to their convenience and started speaking Dhatki. But those who came from a different route from Jaiselmer via Sakhkhar to Sindh region, then Sahevan, Tando Allahyaar, Tando Adam, Badin etc. places or came after some time had influence of Sindhi language on their dialect. Maheshwaris living in Tando Allahyaar and Tando Adam were called ``Tandai'' and their dialect has clear influence of Sindhi. Table \ref{tbl:difftharitandaiguj} throws some light on this fact:

In the same way the dialect spoken in one end of Thar is different than that of the other end. This is shown in the table \ref{tbl:diffmithigad}.

\caption{Differences between Dhatki dialect as spoken in Mithi and Gadhado Villages}
\label{tbl:diffmithigad}
\end{table}
In the towns of Thar, Dhatki language was spoken by Maheshwaris, Brahmins, Bhojak, Shrimalis, Khatris, Malis, Sonaras, Rajputs (Sodha), Meghwal, Bheels, Bajeer etc.. But Lohanas and Muslims used to speak Sindhi however, they could comprehend Dhatki. In some villages, Muslims also used to speak Dhatki. Looking at these details, we can opine that: (1) Thari/Dhatki was basically spoken in Marwad which was brought by Maheshwaris and other communities during their migration. (2) Due to the influence of regional languages from all sides, their is some mixture. (3) Dhat's region that was closer to the other region's have more influence of their respective dialect. (4) School's language of teaching influenced the dialect. (5) Because of an increase in service class people, urban dialect differed from their rural counterparts.

Now let's see the technical and linguistic details of the Thari/Dhatki language:
According to Census of India-1911, Vol. 7, Bombay Presidency, page 168: Distribution of Total Population by Languages:\\
Family\hfill : Indo-European\\
Sub-Family\hfill : Aryan\\
Branch\hfill : Indian\\
Sub-Branch\hfill : Sanskritic\\
Group\hfill : North-Western\\
Language or Dialect \hfill : Thareli (Thari/Dhatki)\\
Total Population in TharParkar District = 3,95,235\\
Population Speaking Thari/Dhatki = 1,16,664\\
Male=64,794, Female=51,870\\
Total=1,16,664 ie. about 30\% of the district.
Now let us compare some Dhatki words with Sindhi and Gujarati (table \ref{tbl:words}).

As seen in tables \ref{tbl:words} and \ref{tbl:sent}, the Dhatki language has been influenced by Gujarati somewhere and Sindhi elsewhere. Some dhatki words have been written in short form of Gujarati words. Means removing the `kaano' accent.

As per Thar's traditions and because of affection with each other, peopl's names were also shortened. We see some samples as presented in table \ref{tbl:names}.
\begin{table}
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\caption{Some Full Names in Dhatki and their Shortened Forms}
\label{tbl:names}
\end{table}
Articles appearing in Sindhi eg. jo, ja, ji and Gujarati eg. no, na, ni are replaced by marwadi style \textbf{ro}, \textbf{ra}, \textbf{ri}. For example:\\

Sindhi: hi chhatti keh ji aahe?\\
Gujarati: aa chhatri koni chhe?\\
\textbf{Dhatki: e kirniyu ke ro ahe?}\\

Dhatki have male and female gender but no neutral gender. Sindhi's `aahe' is `ahe' in Dhatki and its `tho' is `to'. Examples shown in table \ref{tbl:sent}.

There is no systematic literature available of Dhatki/Thari dialect. The language being colloquial, it transferred orally from generation to generation in the form of traditional songs, wedding songs, \textit{sawayas}, \textit{dhamalas}, \textit{shlokas}, festival songs, puzzles/riddles, proverbs etc.. These were spoken on occassions but are increasingly getting less spoken. Recently we heard that in Pakistan's Sindh state, ``The Sindhi Adabi Board'' tried to integrate, maintain and publish a collection of such sparse literature. In that publication's preface some such samples are provided. \textit{sawayas}, \textit{dhamalas} etc belong to the \textit{``pushtimargiya''} genre and so the Maheshwaris of Marwad must be belonging to that genre.

To include the Dhatki language in the Indian constitution, A Maheshwari Member of Parliament put forth a proposal in the Indian Parliament in A.D. 1992-93 but it was not accepted buy the parliament.

\section{Water}
Water is a primary need for humans, animals and plants. Thar being an arid land there was no river and it was not possible to bring up any canals. Here rainwater was the basis of life. Rainwater seeped into the soil was brought up by digging wells. In the ancient times, there was a river called ``hakdo'' that used to flow across the Thar which disappeared because of natural causes like earthquake. Because of this the water table went low in the north-east and up in the south. In Thar, the depth of a well is measured in terms of ``puras''. The length from the toe of a man (Purush) till the finger of elongated hand was considered to be one Puras. This is approximately six feet. The depth of well has been registered as shown in table \ref{tbl:well} in different places.
\begin{table}
\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Depth of wells in Puras in the Thar Region}
\label{tbl:well}
\end{table}

Wells were known as ``tadha'' or ``tad''. Digging well was considered to be holy work. If a person funds to dig and build a well then the name of the well and the place was called after that person. For example, ``Meghe ro Tadho'', ``Dane ro Tadho'' etc..

Wells used to fetch water with different tastes. Different tastes had their names eg. \textbf{Kharo}, \textbf{Charko}, \textbf{Baalo}, \textbf{Kasaro}, \textbf{Ugro}, \textbf{Mitho}. If sweet water was not available, people made it do with the slightly salty water or the water with other tastes.

Wells being in the arid and sandy land in Thar, they were used to be built using special bricks. Such bricks were known as ``nav-terahi'' bricks. Such bricks were very useful in the circular built-up of the wells. Sometimes wells were also built in square shapes. Waters in the wells being deep, they were not used for agriculture but sometimes, vegetables were grown around the wells.

To fetch water from the wells coloured leather \textbf{``kos''} were used. They were tied through thick rope or leather to a pulley and pulled by animals like camels, ox or donkey. The water was filled into place called \textbf{``avada''}. The end that was put into the well was called \textbf{``saaran''}. It used to be approximately as long as the depth of the well itself. Two people used to operate the kos. One the person who orders the camel to pull (called ``khilio-khilivaro'') and the person who held the kos. While the camel pulled the pulley, the person holding the kos used to shout \textbf{``hau hau pachcha, mel pachcha''}. On hearing this the khilio used to stop the camel and pulled out the \textbf{nail} between the rope and kos in order to release the strain on the kos. This resulted into water being flown into the avada. The \textit{paaniharis} used to fetch water from here and the unused water used to go into drain. One such turn was called \textit{``vaaro kaadhyo''} and the people used to fetch water and operate the kos belonged to the Maali community.

Around the Gadhado town where waters were deep, two camels were employed to fetch water. When one camel reaches half way the nail was pulled out and the saran was re-tied to another camel and it used to pull the rest of the way. Thus, the length of saaran was half of the depth of the well.

Some \textbf{``vaishnu''} (Vaishnav) who have dislike for leather used canvas bags called \textbf{``chalsi''} for kos and cotton or \textbf{``akolia''} (cotton-like rope made up from ``aaklo'' plant's pulp) ropes for fetching the water. They used to do it themselves and the water was called \textbf{``bhrahma jal''}.

While the kos is worked, the women of village came to fetch water. Women put the pot of water on their head and used \textbf{``Sindhuni''} to support the pot. They used to put different types of pots (\textbf{``gaggar-morio''}) on sindhuni. These sindhuni's were decorated with mirrorwork, beads and beautiful embroiderries. The behind of the sindhuni had its decorated tail called \textbf{``chhugo''} or \textbf{``chhedo''}. Parents used to gift sindhuni to their married daughters as ``dahej'' (dowry). Poor people used earthen pots. Rich men's ladies did not go to the well to fetch water. They ordered the \textbf{``pakhal''}. The leather pakhal could carry eight pots of water that used to be brought by people called ``pakhali''. The water was emptied in the household pots and the remaining water was put into \textbf{``hodi''} or cement tanks.

Between Chhachhro and Gadhado, there were shallow wells which were called \textbf{``veri''} or \textbf{``par''}. The depth of water in such veris depended upon the rains. Normally, water was found at the depth of 5 to 15 puras. Like tadha's, such veris and pars were known by the names of people who built it. For example, jesse-ro-par, khime-ro-par, waghe-ri-veri, kumbhe-ri-veri, etc.. Some women also had built such tadhas like rupi-ri-veri, maanbaai-ro-tadho. In Mitthi, girls school teacher coming from Saurashtra were called baaisaaheb. She also built one tadho and it was called baaisaaheb-ro-tadho. The taste of water of such veris was similar to \textbf{palar} water.

In some villages, big tanks called \textbf{hod} were built for drinking or water for livestock. Some big tanks were built to store palar water also.

If some bucket or pot fell into a deep well, it was searched using the reflection of mirror (called \textbf{mirio}). The lost item was pulled out using \textbf{``billi''}, a hooked device made of iron and tied to a long rope. Sometimes the maali himself, used to tie himself to rope and went into the well to fetch the thing.

In monsoon, water used to get logged into small lakes in villages and was used for livestock and washing clothes. Such lakes were called \textbf{``tarai''} in Thar. Many towns had such water and its storage capacity was measured in terms of how many months the water will remain.

\begin{center}
% use packages: array
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
\hline
\textbf{Name of the Town} & \textbf{Name of Tarai} & \textbf{Month Capacity} \\
\hline
Mithi & nandhi, wadi tarai & 3-4 months \\ 
Chelhar & ranasar ri tarai & 5-6 months \\ 
Chelhar & Chhichhi ri tarai & 3-4 months \\ 
gadhado & pandhiyari ri tarai & 6 months \\ 
khiysar & - & 4 months \\ 
chhachhro & 2 mile dur tarai & 3 months \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The depth of water in lakes was measures in terms of \textbf{``gode jitto''} (upto knees), \textbf{``chel jitto''} (upto waist), \textbf{``kulhe jitto''} (upto shoulders), \textbf{``mathode taar''} (a man would drown), \textbf{``othi bod''} (a camel would drown - 2-3 mathoda).

Lakes built by people around Gadhado and Bagal were called \textbf{``Garua''}. Rainwater was collected in such garuas. Such garuas were also known by the people who built them. Such as Manakia-ro-garuo, lalania-ro-garuo, vahua-ro-garo etc.. Garua's water was very sweet. There was a \textbf{``chhipo''} lake in Chhachhro where boys and men used to go for bath.

Because of problems associated with depth of well and water fetching, girl's parents hesitated to marry their daughters to such villages. Even in folk songs daughters tell their parents not to marry them in villages where the wells are deep.

In Maheshwaris, unmarried girls never used to go to fetch water. When in-laws sent married woman to fetch water for the first time, they decorated the pot with white paint (called \textbf{``sehdi''}) and used to make rec colored swastikas on the pots. Good decorated sindhunis were given and auspicious time was chosen to send the daughter-in-law to fetch water. This was called \textbf{``vahuari na pani uthiyari''}.

Wells gave water and hence prosperity to people but at the same time some unfortunate man or woman fed up of life used to jump into these wells (\textbf{``tipo deita''}) and commit suicide. Such wells were little used afterwards.
